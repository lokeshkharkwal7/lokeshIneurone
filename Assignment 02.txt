1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans: The 2 values of the boolean are 0 and 1 and you can write it as True and False.


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans. And , Or , Not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean

Ans  1	1	1	0	1
     1	0	1	0	1
     0	1	1	1	0
     0	0	0	0	1

     A	B 	And	Or	Not(Or)

values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 &gt; 4) and (3 == 5)  :1
not (5 &gt; 4) :0
(5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5) :0
not ((5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5)) :1
(True and True) and (True == False) :1
(not False) or (not True) :0

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans- < . > , = ,!= , <= , >=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans. For assignment we use ony single = operator while on comparison we use a double == operator.
for assignment 
x =10

for comparison
x==10


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print(&#39;eggs&#39;)
if spam &gt; 5:
print(&#39;bacon&#39;)
else:
print(&#39;ham&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans - if ( spam == 1 ):
        print("Hello")
 	elif (spam == 2):
        print("Howdy")
      elif (spam == 3):
        print("Greetings !")


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans: We will press ctrl

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans = Break statement will exit you out of the loop while a continue statement will skip that part of block and continue the loop operations.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans : range(10) : will print a value from 0 to 10
while range(0,10) : will print a value from 0 to 10
and range(0,10,1): will give you the value from 0 to 10 with a difference of +1 

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Ans: By using for loop:
for i in range(1 ,10):
    print(i)

By using while loop
count =1
while count!=11:
    print(count)
    count+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Ans: import bacon as ba
     ba.bacon()
